Take note of the fact that the IMPORT statement is located at the very beginning of this example. In words, it says: "in the package `java.util` there is a class called `ArrayList` and we want to use it in our program".

A second method to import classes is using the '\*' symbol. For example, to import ALL the classes in the `java.util` package, we would write `import java.util.*`

Notice that the `java.lang` package is auto-imported for you so that later in the course, when you begin using `String` and `Math` classes, you do not need to import them.
